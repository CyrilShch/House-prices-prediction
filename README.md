# House-prices-prediction

Here I explored the House Prices data.I performed initial cleaning, plotted some charts and trained regression models to predict the price of a house. Additionally, I selected the best values of hyperparameters using cross-validation.

We are using house sale price data from King County, Wahington, USA. This dataset is in public domain and can be obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction

The results are presented in the notebook.
